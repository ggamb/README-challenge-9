## Description
This project involves taking existing code provided by the Universtity of Texas at Austin Coding Bootcamp and refactoring it into README generator. In this project, I used Node.js and ES6 to create a skeleton of a README based on a user's project, details about the project, and github information. After answering the questions, a file titled "README.md" will appear with your generated README file.

See the video below for an illustrative demonstration of how to use this code. The README created in the demo video was the basis for the README in this project!

## Installation
To install this project, you must install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [Inquirer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer). See their respective documentation to ensure that they are installed correctly.

Once they are properly installed, clone the code, navigate to the correct directory, open the terminal, and type "node index" to run the code.

## Usage
See this video for an example for how to use this README generator:
