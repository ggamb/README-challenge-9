## Description
This project involves taking existing code provided by the Universtity of Texas at Austin Coding Bootcamp and refactoring it into README generator. In this project, I used Node.js and ES6 to create a skeleton of a README based on a user's project, details about the project, and github information. In fact, my first commit to this README was made using my own code :)

## Installation
To install this project, you must install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [Inquirer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer).

Once they are installed, simply nagivate to the correct directoy, open the console and type "node index" to run the code.

## Usage
See this video for an example for how to use this README generator:
